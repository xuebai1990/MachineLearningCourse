Hi,

Congratulations to Jingyi, Bai, David, and Paul on the submission of the IFPSC9 manuscript to Fluid Phase Equilibria on Monday.

I want to keep everyone updated on progress with manuscripts and, to make the manuscript queue more tansparent and to allow everyone to learn from the editing process, I also want to start sharing the version submitted to the journal, the version submitted to me, and an annotated version that highlights the changes.

As you know, this manuscript had a hard deadline for submission because it was part of the DDF nomination material for Bai and Paul.  Editing required more than 20 hours, but was still relatively fast because neither additional simulations nor new type of analysis was needed.  I also want to emphasize that the students were involved and aided the editing process by rapid responses to questions and mutliple rounds of proofreading.

I want you to know that you can always discuss preliminary versions of a manuscript and specific figures with me during our new-format group meetings (actually, this is an expectation).  The aim is to help that simulations and analysis are complete before manuscripts are submitted to me.  This process may not always work because it’s likely that I will overlook some problems in these preliminary reviews, these problems then only come to the surface once thinking about the logical flow of the simulations and analysis in the entirety of the results and discussion section.

We are currently working on four manuscripts with complete simulations and analysis (while I’m mostly focusing on the NMGC-2 proposal due by March 24):
- Evgenii and David: FPMD study of choline chloride/urea and its mixture with water;
- Peng: hexane isomer separation;
- Rob and Nitish: dehydration of 1,5-pentanediol;
- Evgenii: CaCO3 nucleation

There are also three manuscripts in the works that are currently waiting for additional simulations or analysis from the students:
- Becky L. and Becky E.: column pairs for 2DLC;
- Kim: LCCC of linear block polymers;
- Bai, David, and Jingyi: assessment of water models with TraPPE-UA alkane models for water/alkane mixtures

I also hope to announce submission of another manuscript soon that passed the 5-hour test.

Submission of these manuscript is teamwork!  The more you help other group members by providing critical feedback on their manuscript drafts, the more time I will have to work on your manuscripts.

Best,

Ilja

P.S: I hope that someone can extend our group wiki by adding a page that allows everyone to download these versions of a manuscript.  After peer review, we will also add the revised version, the annotated version highlighting changes, and the .tex file for the revised version.
